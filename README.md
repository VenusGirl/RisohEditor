## FAQ

### Question 1. What is "Risoh"?

The word "risoh" means "ideal" in Japanese.

### Question 2. What are edt1, edt2, cmb1?

Those are standard control ID macros defined in `<dlgs.h>`.

### Question 3. What is mcdx?

It's a special message compiler I made. See [mcdx/MESSAGETABLEDX.md](https://github.com/katahiromz/RisohEditor/blob/master/mcdx/MESSAGETABLEDX.md) for details.

### Question 4. Why did I get garbled characters when compiling with Visual Studio?

The resource compiler of MSVC has a bug in treatment of UTF-8 resource files.

Use UTF-16 (but UTF-16 is not supported in GNU windres).

### Question 5. What is the difference between no installer and portable version?

The portable version doesn't use registry but an ini file.

### Question 6. Does it support 64-bit?

Yes, it does.
